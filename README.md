# **Caesar Cipher Program — Task 01**

## 🔐 Overview  
This project is a simple implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the oldest and most well-known encryption techniques.  
The program allows users to:

- **Encrypt** a message  
- **Decrypt** a message  
- Enter a custom **shift value**

The cipher works by shifting each letter of the message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.

## 🧠 How the Caesar Cipher Works  
The Caesar Cipher is a **substitution cipher** where:

- Each letter in the plaintext is shifted right (for encryption)  
- And left (for decryption) by the same shift value  

For example, with a shift of **3**:
